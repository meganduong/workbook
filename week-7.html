            <h3>>Arduino Kit Introduction</h3>
            <p>This activity involved us guessing/learning the names of the pieces given in the Arduino Kit.
                <br>This was helpful since I could only name about 3 or 4 things in the kit.

            <h3>>01. LED with Button</h3>
            <p>First build with the kit. This was more just to understand how a basic electric circuit works, using a battery, power supply module, a resistor, LED, button and jumper wires.
                <br>This also helped us understand how the breadboard works.

            <p>Here were used the same circuit from above but the input was now from the potentiometer, which acts as a dial.</p>

            <p>This was another exploration of the potentiometer, but this time the output was the activation of the fan.</p>

            <h3>>04. Ultrasonic Sensor Traffic Lights</h3>
            <p>Here I practiced building circuits during the mid-semester break and experimented with different Arduino codes after having been introduced to the BlINK in class.
                <br>This build involved using an ultrasonic sensor, where the distance of my hand resulted in two outputs: the 'traffic lights' going from green to red as the hand got closer, and the buzzer playing a frequency that became higher as the hand got closer.

            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>“Everyone deserves applause”, says Liu Chang. Chorus (2021) invites visitors to stand upon a wooden podium before a mechanical audience, which then begins to applaud. The automated clapping is cold and mindless, making the visitor feel uncomfortable and vulnerable, rather than proud and validated. 
<br>
                <br>This is most likely due to the audiences’ uncanny, empty and headless appearance, giving them no personality or warmth.  Additionally, the sculpture invites reflection on the tension between individuality and conformity in both technological and social systems.
                <br>
               <br> I have personally experienced this piece, and it was extremely scary so I got off the platform as soon as I could. The room was very dark and the clapping was very loud.</p>

            <h3>Murmuring Minds</h3>
            <p>Murmuring Minds is an installation composed of sixty autonomously moving rectangular blocks that mimic the collective behaviours of swarms. Participants are able to engage with changing the landscape as their presence influences the motion and reconfiguration of the blocks, creating a dynamic feedback loop between human and machine. 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                As participants navigate the environment, they become part of a performative system that challenges notions about leadership, control and the ethics of cohabitation with autonomous systems.
