        <h3>Week 8 was a continuation of what we learnt in Week 7 and reflected on during the mid semester break.
             <br> We focused on touch, primarily using the photoresistor to create a 'theremin-like' point of interaction. </h3>

            <h3>>01. Theremin Buzzer</h3>
            <p>Hooked up to the Arduino, the buzzer would play a frequency when your finger hovered over the photoresistor.
                <br>I thought at first this worked similar to the ultrasonic sensor that detects distance, like the traffic lights I made last week, but the photoresistor actually measures light intensity.

            <h3>>02. Theremin 'Fish'</h3>
            <p>This build we used the photoresistor to cause the 'fish' to move.
                <br>This was achieved through using a servo motor, where on the code on the Arduino, you could control the angle the motor would rotate to. (0 to 180 deg)

            <h3>>03. Touch Instrument</h3>
            <p>The last build we did this class created a musical instrument that was played through conductive touch.
                <br>Each wire acted as a conductor, and with the code on the Arduino would play the notes C,D,E,F,G respectively from the buzzer.

            <h3>The Embroidered Computer</h3>
            <p>This is a fully functional 8-bit computer constructed using embroidery with conductive threads and beads called The Embroidered Computer (2023) by Irene Posch.
                <br>
                <br>
                Playing with juxtapositions of tradition vs tech, slow vs fast, craft vs computer, the work challenges conventional hierarchies between "soft" domestic labor and "hard" technological production.
                <br>
                <br>
                The piece functions both as an electronic circuit and a decorative textile, reframing the computer not as a cold, sealed object of authority but as a visible, material and potentially personal artefact, delving into conversations about gender, labor and the aesthetics of technological design.</p>

            <h3>Ghost Box</h3>
            <p>Ghost Box (2018) by Steven Parker is a tactile sound sculpture modelled after a WWII-era shortwave radio, which is activated through touch.
                <br>
                <br>
                As participants interact with the object, it emits strange looped audio fragments from various languages and codes such as Morse code and Hebrew. These eerie audios when played and layered evoke echoes of war, ritual and ancient communication, inviting the user to reflect and connect across different realms of place and time
                <br>
                <br>
                The name itself “ghost box” reminds me of what paranormal activity hunters use as a medium for spectral ‘ghost’ voices, proving how technology can resurrect lost signals and memories.
