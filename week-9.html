        <h3>>01 Arduino Superserial – Draw Circle</h3>
        <p>This workshop involved a simple build using only the potentiometer connected to the Arduino pins GND, 5V and A0.
          <br>The p5.js script drew a circle, with the input values of the potentiometer controlling the size of the circle and colour of the background.

        <h3>>02 Arduino Superserial – Capture</h3>
        <p>This is me trying to experiment with alternative outputs in class. Here i managed to createCapture(VIDEO) and use the mappedData to control the width of the image  </p>

        <h3>>03 Arduino Superserial – Changing Colour</h3>
        <p>Here I did some futher experimentation at home. This example also controls the colour of the circle, using the data from the potentiometer map RBG values. <br>

        <h3>>04 Arduino Superserial – Adjusting Filter</h3>
        <p>Here I used the potentiometer to control the level/intensity of the p5 posterize filter. </p>

      <h3>The Penguins Mirror</h3>
      <p>Penguins Mirror (2015) by Daniel Rozin is an interactive kinetic installation composed of 450 black-and-white stuffed penguins, each mounted on a motor. Using a video camera to track the viewer’s movement, the penguins rotate in unison to form a dynamic, low-resolution mirror that reflects the viewer’s silhouette in real time. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think it is always interesting to see animatronic/ robotic kids toys used in a different content. While the penguins bring a hint of whimsy and playfulness to the piece, its mundane roll of rotating and reflecting the users’ silhouette reduces the toy down to its basic inner mechanical workings and purpose.</p>

      <h3>Study for Fifteen Points</h3>
      <p>
        Composed of fifteen mechanised LED points suspended in space, Study for Fifteen Points(2015) by Random International is a light sculpture that mimics the motion of a walking human figure.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, despite the absence of a visible body, viewers are able to instinctively recognise the illuminated form as human, highlighting the brain’s ability to synthesise sparse visual cues into coherent representations. 
<br>
<br>
I find this interesting as I find this similar to how biometric technology can recognise the identity of someone from just a number of points on the face.
